# chatbot
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built with Python. It responds to user input using predefined commands stored in a dictionary and selects replies randomly to make conversations more natural. The chatbot is designed for beginners to practice core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and user input handling.
